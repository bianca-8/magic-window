# magic window

Dashboard for Kindle that displays the weather outside!

Supports sun, clear sky, rain, snow, etc.

You have a character that lives in this world and walks around (kind of like the people in Harry Potter picture frames)

When it is snowing, you need to "shovel" the snow to clear it and show the time.

This can be placed on a desk to show people who don't go outside (coders hiding in their room coding all day...AND have their curtains closed...) the beauty of the world outside!
